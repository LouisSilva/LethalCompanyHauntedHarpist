# Haunted Harpist
**Adds to the game a new enemy/monster called the Haunted Harpist.**
<p>The Haunted Harpist is an enemy that initially roams the map while playing its haunting melody on the harp. If provoked during its performance—whether by excessive noise, stunning, or direct attack—the Haunted Harpist will cease its serene music, dropping its harp to engage aggressively with anyone it perceives.</p>

<p>Dealing with the angry ghost may prove difficult, but it is worth it to obtain the harp.</p>

# The Phantom Piper & Ethereal Enforcer
The Phantom Piper plays the bagpipes.

Unlike the Haunted Harpist, the Phantom Piper is scared of players and will run away, bagpipes in hand, when provoked.

Although luckily for him, he is always escorted by his own Ethereal Enforcers.

# FAQ

<br></br>
**Can I configure the spawn values?**

Yes, the spawn values for the ghosts are fully customizeable in the configs.

<br></br>
**Why are the Ethereal Enforcers so overpowered?**

The Phantom Piper and his escorts are supposed to be a rare enemy in the game, with a high risk - high reward for trying to steal the bagpipes.

Even though they have a shield and 6 HP (configurable), they have big weaknesses which can be easily exploited (some are obvious, some of them aren't so).

<br></br>
**Does this mod support v66?**

Yes

**I found a bug, where can I report it?**
